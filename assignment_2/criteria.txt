(c) __EXCEPTIONS_AND_LOGGING__
Since there is no user input and guard conditions handle the majority of scenarios, the primary exceptions that need handling are IO exceptions during file writing. 
These exceptions are critical and are logged as severe errors to ensure they are highlighted for immediate attention.
Other logging statements are logged at info level, including FAILURE messages as they are part of the simulation and not due to external errors.

(d) __FACTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_AND_DEPENDENCY_INJECTION__
The StateFactory class is designed to determine the initial state of a bike (BikeState) based on the input message received. 
The StateFactory class contains a single method that returns an instance of either ForPurchaseState or InServiceState depending on the input message. 
BikeState is then injected to a Bike object via its constructor, eliminating hard-coded dependencies.

(e) __OBSERVER_PATTERN__

The Observer Pattern is used to handle the responses to any event that may occur in the duration of the program. 
An event causes the subject to change it’s state and all the observers are notified and updated automatically. 

In this implementation, the 'BikeShop' class serves as the subject, generating events and notifying its observers. 
There are two concrete observers, 'Display' and 'WriteToFile', which handle the events by displaying messages on the console and writing them to a file, respectively.

The 'BikeShop' class is responsible for generating events. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them whenever there is an event, such as the output of error messages, input messages, and statistics.

Both 'Display' and 'WriteToFile' observers are registered in the 'observers' list of the 'BikeShop' class. 
When an event occurs, the 'BikeShop' class notifies all registered observers by calling their respective update methods.

The decision to use a single observer pattern for all types of messages including errors is based on the need to avoid code duplication. 
A separate observer class for errors would lead to redundant code segments and errors would only occur in certain instances as opposed to regular input messages and statistics. 
Hence, to maintain the organised structure, the errors would be passed off as Strings to ‘WriteToFile’ and ‘Display’ observers, where the Display class would also independently track the count of failures.


(f) __STATE_PATTERN_____
In this program, the class 'Bike' represents the subject whose state changes between 'ForPurchase', 'Waiting', and 'InService'. 
A bike can initially be in the 'ForPurchase' or 'InService' state depending on the whether a purchase or a drop off occurs. 
The 'StateFactory' class is used to assign the initial state of a bike according to the event that occurred.

### ForPurchase State
When a 'PURCHASE-IN-STORE' or 'PURCHASE-ONLINE' request comes through, the initial state of the bike is set to 'ForPurchase', indicating that the bike is available for purchase.

- In-Store Purchase: If the bike is purchased in-store, there is no further transition, so the state flow ends for that bike.
- Online Purchase: If the bike is sold online, the state transitions to the 'Waiting' state where it awaits pickup.

### InService State
In the event of a 'DROP-OFF' request, the initial state is set to 'InService' if the request is approved.

- Service Completion: The method 'twoDays()' tracks whether two days have passed since service. 
        If so, this method transitions the state of the bike to the 'Waiting' state where the bike waits to be picked up and paid for.

### WaitingState
In this state, a bike is awaiting pickup after maintenance or being purchased online. 
If the bike is requested for 'PICK-UP' before service completion, an error is displayed. 
If servicing is done, it is paid for before the state flow ends.

This approach allows a clear and structured handling of state transitions based on the occurrence of specific events.
