# Syllabus

This unit introduces students to advanced object-oriented design for a given 
set of software requirements, focusing on
<ul>
  <li>UML modeling - from design to implementation </li>
  <li>polymorphic design patterns - for creating highly cohesive and loosely-coupled designs</li>
  <li>MVC architecture - for separation of concerns</li>
  <li>containers and generics - to promote design reuse</li>
  <li> factories and dependency injection - for design testability</li>
</ul>
